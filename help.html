				<h1>How to use this site</h1>

				<b>Summary</b>
				<p>The website is a simple tool to easily calculate your total hours worked each day which can then be copied 
				into your company's timesheet system. You enter in your start time, the details about the task you are doing 
				and the end time when you finish the task. The page will then calculate how many hours this task took.<br>
				<br>
				Multiple tasks can be entered throughout the day and it will total up the day's work. Basically it saves you 
				time doing mental math to work out how many hours you need to put down for each task. It is useful for 
				consultancy based companies who have to bill by the hour to various projects throughout the week.</p>

				<b>Key points</b>
				<ol>
					<li>Use 24 hour time for the <i>Hour</i> and <i>Min</i> columns.</li>
					<li>
						Always click the <i>Calculate and save</i> button if you've made changes. This saves the timesheet 
						data into the browser's storage so you can then close the page or browser and resume later. The 
						data will stay there as long as you don't clear your browser's history.
					</li>
					<li>
						The clock icon next to <i>Start</i> and <i>End</i> on each row inserts the current local time. 
						Use this if you are just starting or finishing a task.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<b>Grouping tasks together</b>
				<p>If you work on the same task at different times of the day you can click the subtotal checkbox next to 
				each task so they are grouped together. When you click the <i>Calculate and save</i> button it will total
				up the time spent on those tasks and show it at the bottom of the page. For example:<br>
				<br>
				<img src="img/help-subtotalling.png">
				</p>
				
				<b>Backing up your timesheets</b>
				<p>
					You should backup the timesheet every day and save it to a file on your hard drive. That way you can 
					restore and view previous timesheets if you need to. Click the <i>Download</i> button to save the 
					timesheet to your hard drive. For example:<br>
					<br>
					<img src="img/help-timesheet-backup-1.png"><br>
					<br>
					<img src="img/help-timesheet-backup-2.png">
				</p>
				
				<b>Restoring your timesheet</b>
				<p>Restoring is as simple as choosing the file you want to restore and opening it.</p>

				<b>Technical information</b>
				<p>
					The site uses the latest technologies in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">HTML5</a> and 
					<a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>. Data is saved locally in each user's browser using 
					<a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage/">HTML 5 local storage</a>. The website is also saved 
					into <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/offline.html">HTML5 offline application cache</a> so that 
					the page can be loaded instantly from the browser cache rather from the server each time. It is 
					expected the page will be reloaded multiple times each day and week so there's no need to download 
					the website each time from the server.
				</p>
				<p>
					Due to the new technologies being used the only current supported browsers are the latest versions 
					of <a href="http://mozilla.com">Firefox</a>, <a href="http://google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a>, 
					<a href="http://apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> or <a href="http://opera.com">Opera</a>. 
					<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/ie9">Internet Explorer 9</a> may also work but is untested at 
					this time.
